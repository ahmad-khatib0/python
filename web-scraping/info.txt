- There are three basic types of intellectual property: trademarks (indicated by a ™ or ® symbol), 
  copyrights (the ubiquitous ©), and patents (sometimes indicated by text noting that the invention is
  patent protected or a patent number but often by nothing at all).

- When Google web scrapers (also known as Googlebots) crawl websites, they make a copy of the site and
  host it on the internet. Anyone can access this cache, using the URL format:
  http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://pythonscraping.com

- SERP Scraping
  SERP, or search engine results page scraping, is the practice of scraping useful data 
  directly from search engine results without going to the linked pages themselves.
